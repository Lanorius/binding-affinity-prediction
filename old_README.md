## Description

## Setup

### BindingDB

To use the preprocessing for BindingDB, please unpack "BindingDB_All.7z" in the sub "folder data/bdb"

## Usage


### Preprocess Data

To pre-process the data from the "data" sub folder the scripts in "src/data_preprocessing" can be used by calling:

```
python preprocess_files_main.py
```

The settings can be configured in the config.ini in the data_preprocessing sub folder.


### Training a model

To train a new model, according to the set configurations, the following command can be used in the src folder:
```
binding_prediction.py
```

#### config.ini

This file is for adjusting the settings that should be used for training a new model.

### Load pre-trained model and load new data

TODO - currently doesn't exist

## ToDOs

* automatically unpack bindingDB_All.7z?
* more documentation (doc strings, description of config file parameters, ...)
* create requirements file

## Future ideas

* investigate binned predictions more
  * remap predictions to label values
  * std error and other performance metrics for binary predictions
  * make binary predictions work with existing evaluation code
  * ...
* LSTM/RNN/Attention etc for affinity prediction?
* add other embedding preprocessing options? (Compounds and/or Proteins)
* more visualizations
  * training vs validation curve?
  * more visualizations to identify difficult pairs?
* multi threaded cross-training?
